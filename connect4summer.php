			<h2>What is Connect 4 Families?</h2>
			<p>Park Community School and Romsey Community School in partnership successfully bid to Hampshire County Council to receive Holiday Activity Funding 2021. The funding is to provide a programme of free holiday activities and healthy food for disadvantaged children during 2021 Easter holidays.</p>
			<p>Our plans for 2021 are based on our experience in delivering this programme in 2019 and 2020 for the Department for Education. Our programme provides enriching activities for children and also for the parents through our Family Fun Days. The venues are throughout Hampshire in many different areas and venues.</p>

			<h2>Connect4Summer 2020 - Review</h2>
			<p>Connect4Summer has been successful for its second year, and we are extremely proud of the joy and happiness we have managed to bring to families while helping with mental health issues raised by COVID-19.</p>
			<p>We have been able to bring a 20-day programme to venues around Hampshire, Portsmouth, Southampton and Isle of Wight while maintaining government guidelines.</p>
			<p>Please take the time to view our Connect4Summer 2020 review, and we'd like to thank all the 420+ employed to make this fantastic event possible once again.</p>
