            <h3>Springwood's Aim</h3>
            <p>To provide a welcoming, safe but challenging environment where children can learn at their own pace whilst having fun. Our children are encouraged, with the support of our friendly staff, to experience challenge through play. Play enables children to progress and develop new skills. Learning through play allows the children to talk and think for themselves.</p>

            <p>The staff at Springwood are guided by the national curriculum for 0-5 years called the Early Years Foundation Stage. We see every child as an individual learner. </p>
