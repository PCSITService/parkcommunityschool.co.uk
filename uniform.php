            <h3>The Principle of Uniform</h3>
            <p>Students should take pride in their uniform, care in their appearance, and look smart at all times.</p>
            <p>School is a place of work and preparation for working life. The school uniform and appearance rules support good behaviour and discipline across the school.</p>
            <p>We wish to encourage some choice, however do avoid extremes or competition in fashion.</p>
