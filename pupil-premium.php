          <p>At Park Community School we are committed to providing ALL students with a great education; securing strong academic outcomes alongside experiences of the curriculum and the world around us which broaden horizons and encourage a love of learning. We encourage students to discover what they love and therefore invest heavily in developing the quality of teaching and enabling all students to access a broad and balanced curriculum, which includes a wealth of experiences outside of the classroom.</p>
          
          <p>Our Pupil Premium Strategy is focussed on 4 broad areas:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Behaviour for learning that allows all to succeed</li>
            <li>Attendance and parental engagement</li>
            <li>All students to be able to read at their chronological age and above</li>
            <li>High quality teaching which develops independence</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Our Pupil Premium strategy is based on a comprehensive understanding of our students, their families and the community. We regularly review its impact using internal and external data and current research produced the Education Endowment Foundation. Park Community School participated in the ‘Improving Outcomes for Disadvantaged Learners’ project with Hampshire and Rosendale Research during 2017-18, and is currently taking part in the Havant Tackling Disadvantage project in partnership with other local schools and HIAS.</p>

          <p>For 2021/2022 the school has received the following amounts:</p>

                <tr>
                  <td>Pupil Premium</td>

                  <td>£0</td>
                </tr>
              </table>

          <p>Grant Allocation:</p>
          <p>In 2019/2020 the school received £434,635 for Pupil Premium (PP) and £17,965 for Looked After Children (LAC). </p>
          <p>The school spent £560,622 providing additional support for PP students. The pupil Premium is grant funding and is in addition to the school’s Delegated Budget. The school chooses to invest additional funding from its delegated budget to support pupil Premium funding.</p>
          <p>The Pupil Premium is allocated by calculating the number of students who are on Free School Meals (FSM) or have had FSM in the last six years. Students who have been in care continuously for more than six months or have a parent in the Armed Services also lead to some additional funding for the school.</p>

          <p>In 2019 the gap in achievement between non-PP and PP students in GCSEs was -0.39 for Progress 8 (PP-1.09, non-PP -0.69</p>
          <p>In 2019/20 1:1 reading intervention with 69 students has seen 81% of students making double ratio gains, with a further 6% making progress but below the double ratio gains. Year 7 in the group made on average 28 months progress, Year 8 22 months and year 11 26 months. 70 % of the 60 students who made progress have now made enough progress that they have moved in to the correct chronological age reading bracket.</p>
          <p>Main barriers to educational achievement faced by eligible students could include:</p>
                <ul class="circle">
                   <li>Low aspiration</li>
                   <li>Gaps in learning, including for a significant number of low reading ages that makes accessing texts a significant challenge</li>
                   <li>Reading ages below chronological age</li>
                   <li>Parents who have poor experiences of school, or have not completed further education or in some cases do not value education</li>
                   <li>Large number of siblings</li>
                   <li>Often in single parent families</li>
                   <li>May have experienced significant trauma in earlier years eg alcohol abuse, domestic violence</li>
                   <li>Lack of trust in, or significant dependence on, outside agencies</li>

                   <li>Low self-esteem</li>
                   <li>Low exposure to the wider community which impacts negatively on a student’s Cultural Capital.</li>

               <p>This is not an exhaustive list and by no means applies to all students who may qualify for Pupil Premium. </p>

    		<h3>Catch-up Funding for Year 7 - 2019/2020</h3>

			<p><strong>In 2019 - 2020 we received £19,989, which is used to help these students secure and close gaps in their literacy and numeracy through small group intervention, 1 to 1 intervention, the Reading Plus programme and in class support.</strong></p>

			<p>This money was used for:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>One to one reading, spelling and literacy intervention for 49 Year 7 students</li> 
				<li>Additional classroom support for one class (18 students).</li> 
				<li>Reading Plus programme brought in for use with the year group.</li>
        <li>In total more than 150 students benefitted from this intervention, 49 from 1 to 1 intervention. The impact of this support was measured through: student and parent feedback, Year 7 progress data, reading and spelling data.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>All students receiving intervention demonstrated improvement in their reading, language or spelling skills with the average gain at or above double ratio. Spelling and reading data collections demonstrated that this progress was maintained after the intervention therefore demonstrating the mastery of key skills enabling them to continue to make progress.</p>

			<p>Parent and student feedback demonstrated positive increases regarding confidence and perception of ability alongside willingness to engage in additional learning outside of the classroom.</p>

			<h3>Coronavirus Catch-up Premium (2020-2021)</h3>

      <p><strong>The allocation of £70,960 will be received in three tranches and will be used to deliver small group and 1 to 1 tuition.</strong></p>
