        <h4>HCC Community Impact Award</h4>
        <p>We are delighted to announce that Park Community School were last night awarded Hampshire County Council’s ‘Community Impact Award’.</p> 
        <p>We have been successful in winning this award in respect of <a href="/munch.php">our MUNCH project</a>, which aims to reduce food poverty for the benefit of local children, young people and families in Leigh Park.</p>
        <p>We started MUNCH, which runs every day through the school holidays, Thursday tea times and the last Sunday of the month to ensure local families always have something to eat.</p>
