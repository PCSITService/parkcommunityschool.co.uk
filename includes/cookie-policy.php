It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
    
    <p>In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other data. In such cases, our <a href="/privacy-policy.php">Privacy Policy</a> will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.</p>
    
    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>

    <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Park Community School) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (such as analytics, interactive content, and social media features).

    <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
    <p>We use first and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.

Third parties serve cookies through our website for analytics and other purposes.</p>
    
    <h2>Legal basis for using cookies</h2>
