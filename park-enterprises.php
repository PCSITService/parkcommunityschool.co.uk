            <h3>Organisational Aims</h3>
            <p>The aim of this company is to offer a wide range of opportunities, not offered within the normal school environment, which help students gain confidence, plus work and life skills in a real working environment. We prioritise the safeguarding of students and ensure that their  learning is enhanced and meets the requirements of the National Curriculum.</p>

            <p>In order to offer these opportunities, we have affiliate relationships with other organisations that provide education, skills and training for young people.</p>

            <p>It is our intention to create and run many enterprise projects so that we can expose our students to a whole range of different work environments. These provide the opportunity for students to learn a wide variety of skills, including those in the construction and motor industries.</p>

            <p>Our financial strategy means that all monies earned are used to further pursue the organisational objectives.</p>
