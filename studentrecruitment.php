            <p>At Park we recognise how difficult it is for young people to gain valuable work experience so we have work experience for students.</p>

            <p>Students will go through a recruitment process including:</p>
            <ul class="circle">
                <li>Completing an application form and supplying references,</li>
                <li>Undertaking a group task,</li>
                <li>Being Interviewed.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The law states that children must be 13 years of age to be employed therefore Year 7/8s can only volunteer, they will receive reward points and their work experience will be recognised in any application for positions in Year 9.</p>

            <p>If your application is succesful you will need to complete a work permit form which a parent or carer will need to sign and Hampshire County Council will have to approve before you begin work. This is to make sure that you are only working the number of hours which is allowed for young people of your age.Â </p>
