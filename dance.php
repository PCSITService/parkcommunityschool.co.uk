            <h3>Intent</h3>
            <p><strong>Lighting Fires</strong> The Performing Arts intention is to ignite the flame of curiosity and passion within in the hearts and minds of the students at park. We thrive to deliver and develop key live skills and to nurture passionate, imaginative, and creative individuals, preparing them for further education and future careers. The performing arts curriculum prepares students to become independent and creative through the delivery of a diverse range of schemes of work which allows students to develop an understanding of different styles and practitioners. Furthermore, the performing arts curriculum promotes a sense of self-worth and encourages a growth in confidence, resilience, and autonomy.</p>
                        
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
