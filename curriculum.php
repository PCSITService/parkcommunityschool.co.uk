            <h3>Curriculum Overview 2020-2021</h2>
            <p>At Park we provide a broad curriculum which allows students to find what they love to do. Our curriculum is designed to promote attainment, build resilience and increase autonomy. We are known for our inclusive approach and others describe us as ‘much more than just a school’.</p>
            <ul class="circle">We do this through:
                <li>A broad and traditional curriculum which leads to a wide range of GCSEs and other qualifications</li>
                <li>Our ‘Much More Than Just a School’ curriculum which provides an exciting range of memorable experiences for our students</li>
                <li>Literacy underpins education at Park. Children read each day; those who struggle with their reading are well supported</li>
                <li>Cultural capital is important for GCSE success and success in life. We build cultural capital throughout the curriculum</li>
                <li>Personal development is fundamental to what we do in preparing students for life after school and the world of work. Our widely recognised careers programme gives children in every year group opportunities to consider their future and meet people from outside of school</li>
                <li>We encourage students to be ambitious through our links with colleges and universities</li>
                <li>SMSC at Park promotes British Values through a comprehensive programme of assemblies, personal development and Challenge Days</li>
                <li>Engaging Park students in our story and developing a sense of pride in this community</li>
            </ul>
