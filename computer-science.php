                	<h3>Intent</h3>
                    <p>Computing sits at the cornerstone of the modern world, affecting the way we communicate and work as it encompasses Digital Literacy, IT and Computer Science. With this in mind our curriculum offers a pathway for our students to explore the use of applications and the creation of software to solve complex real-world problems through the use of algorithmic thinking, which consists of abstraction, decomposition and pattern recognition. Our focus is to develop confident independent learners who can apply thinking and reasoning skills developed in computing and other iStem subjects across the curriculum.</p>
                    <p>We aim to develop competent students who are able to express themselves using a variety of applications and problem-solving techniques which allows them to tackle challenging problems related to business and the communication of data. To achieve this, students must master a number of applications including the ability to decompose a problem into smaller more manageable tasks through the use of abstraction to clarify the important details contained in a specification brief. In order to master these skills students are exposed to familiar and unfamiliar contexts which require the application of critical thinking skills to simplify computable problems. Due to the crossover between Maths and Computer Science students will be encouraged to make use of mathematical formulae when they develop software solutions as well as the use of algebra to develop and test programming concepts.</p>

					<h3>Implementation</h3>

						<ul>
							<li>Enhancing problem solving strategies through challenging programming projects</li>
							<li>Investigating the history of computing and the impact of technology on society</li>
							<li>Exploring how computer networks allow for communication and collaboration</li>
							<li>Deepen the skills and knowledge required to communicate via HTML and JavaScript, which many businesses state is a skill they want in employees</li>
							<li>Games design through project based learning and application of critical thinking whilst assessing the needs of users</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>GCSE Computer Science</h3>
					<p>Computer Science is a highly creative subject that calls on learners to be inventive. To help us develop this engaging, modern qualification, we talked to companies like Microsoft, Google and Cisco; organisations like Computing at School (CAS) and also teachers and other academics.</p>

					<p>At GCSE our students will follow the OCR Specification which explores a range of concepts which aims to equip and prepare candidates to complete programming projects with an awareness of the technologies that support their creation. This is achieved through two strands, Computer Systems and Computational Thinking.</p>

					<p>Understanding of computer systems will include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Studying how processors work especially the Von Neumann architecture</li>
							<li>Investigating computer memory and storage.</li>
							<li>Exploring modern network layouts and how they function to provide platforms for communication and collaboration</li>
							<li>Building skills in the increasingly important realm of cyber security</li>
							<li>Investigating how types of software are used within computer systems</li>
							<li>Considering how computing can affect ethical, legal, cultural and environmental issues</li>
						</ul>

					<p>Computational Thinking is approached though:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Solve complex problems through abstraction and decomposition</li>
							<li>Studying fundamental algorithms in computer science </li>
							<li>Building a firm foundation in programming techniques</li>
							<li>Producing programs through planning via flow diagrams</li>
							<li>Thoroughly testing programs and make them resistant to misuse</li>
							<li>Exploring Boolean algebra (AND, OR, NOT).</li>
							<li>Understanding how we store data within computers using binary</li>
						</ul>


					<h3>What will a student gain from this course? </h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Valuable thinking and programming skills that are extremely attractive in the modern workplace</li>
							<li>A deep understanding of problem solving and experience in creating logical and efficient solutions</li>
							<li>Ability to demonstrate solutions to problems for other people to understand.</li>
							<li>A good grounding in mainstream computing theory and understanding</li>
						</ul>



					<h3>What could your child do next?</h3>
					<p>Our GCSE (9-1) Computer Science is effective preparation for a range of qualifications including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>AS Level Computer Science.</li>
							<li>A Level Computer Science.</li>
							<li>Cambridge Technicals – IT Level 3 or Digital Media Level 3 </li>
						</ul>
					<p>(these are OCR vocational qualifications that offer an alternative to A levels for students aged 16+).</p>
					<p>It also provides a good grounding for other subject areas that require problem solving and analytical skills.</p>



					<h3>What Careers could a GCSE in Computer Science lead to?</h3>
					<p>There are many different careers that our qualifications could help students move towards.</p>
					<p>Here are some examples of sample career paths:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Data Analyst</li>
							<li>Games Developer</li>
							<li>Networks Manager</li>
							<li>Software Architect</li>
							<li>Robotics Engineer</li>
							<li>Multimedia Programmer</li>
							<li>Cyber Security</li>
							<li>Forensic Computing</li>
							<li>Animator</li>
							<li>Web Design</li>
							<li>App development</li>
							<li>Nanotechnologist</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Parents can help their children by:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Encouraging your son/daughter to discuss the different ways of arriving an answer. Reasoning and conversation lie at the heart of developing problem-solving skills, so talking about school work will help him/her develop as a good computer scientist.</li>
							<li>Additional challenge can be added by asking ‘What if…?’, and then change the problem in some way.</li>
							<li>Allowing your son/daughter to ‘teach’ you.</li>
							<li>Involving him/her in real-life problem-solving, such as algorithms used for decision making for example: traffic light sequences, level crossings, heating controls and alarm systems</li>
							<li>Challenging him/her to draw algorithms as flow diagrams of write pseudocode to solve problems</li>
							<li>If your son/daughter is doing well, praise him/her for the effort s/he has put in ('well done, you worked so hard!'), rather than applauding her 'talent'. This will help him/her to learn that s/he can always develop his/her abilities as long as s/he works hard.</li>
							<li>When s/he gets stuck, ask him/her to explain what s/he has done so far and what exactly s/he is finding hard. Try and help him/her to work out where s/he has gone wrong.</li>
							<li>Trying to ask open-ended questions to keep a conversation going and explain that, with maths, there is often more than one way to solve problems</li>
