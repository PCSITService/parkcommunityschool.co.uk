            <p>In 2018 the Department for Education commenced a three-year trial programme to provide summer holiday activities and food for children entitled to free school meals. 2019 Park Community School and Romsey Community School in partnership submitted a bid to provide the programme in the Hampshire area. This proved to be very successful and was repeated in 2020.</p>

            <p>In 2021 the funding was distributed through local authorities, and we achieved funding for Easter and Summer 2021. We deliver a programme called Connect4Families and parents/carers come with their children and take part in a range of activities that are fun, challenging, learning, cooking activity and everyone enjoys a 2-course hot lunch. For 11-16year group we provide Connect4Youth, and young people choose an activity to spend the day with specialists in that field. Often, they experience an activity they have never had the chance to do, again we provide a 2-course hot lunch for them.</p>
