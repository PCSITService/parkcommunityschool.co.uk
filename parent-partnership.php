            <h2>Our aims are expressed through the following principles:</h2>

            <p>At Park Community School we assess your child regularly in lessons to allow us to monitor their progress in relation to what we would expect them to achieve. We then adjust our lesson planning or implement interventions to ensure they are making suitable progress.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>We have 5 ways of expressing our work:</h3>

            <p><strong>Much more than just a school</strong> [We aim to perpetually innovate in order to provide aspiration, inspiration and new ways to work with young people, parents and our local community. We therefore offer an expansive educational experience: Apex Construction Skills Centre, Park Farm, PDP; Print and enterprise unit and Inspired Education, SCITT and Solent Teaching Alliance].</p>
            <p><strong>Success for all through attainment, resilience and autonomy</strong> [We aim to ensure that all of our students are well prepared for the next step of long successful lives; demonstrating finish, polish, panache].</p>
            <p><strong>We are guardians of the flame; kindling fires</strong> [“At Park we will be at your child's side every step of the way, guiding them as their character develops and as they make their own discoveries about what they love.” We believe education is a way to change lives: to kindle fires and awaken possibilities].</p>
            <p><strong>Love to teach: joy, glee and delight</strong> [We believe all learners should be welcomed, inspired, challenged, and invested in as individuals, we also believe all staff should model passion for Park so students and their families experience joy, glee and delight].</p>
            <p><strong>We believe that we make a difference and that qualifications alone are not enough we believe in empowering students to feel confident, be independent and make good choices</strong> [existentialism] <strong>within a caring and sharing community</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Capital</h2>
            <p>We all have different skills, tastes in music, and life experiences, to name a few. So why is cultural capital important? Our cultural capital gives us power. It helps us achieve goals, become successful, and get on in life, without necessarily having wealth.</p>
            <p>This booklet has been designed to inform our parents and carers how they can help support their child within each subject at Park Community School.</p>
            <p>It outlines websites to look at, visits and cultural experiences your child may enjoy out of school hours to support them in their education, along with recommended books to read.</p>
