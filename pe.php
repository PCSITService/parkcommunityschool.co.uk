        <h3>Intent</h3>
            <p>As a department we aim to create an inspirational working environment for both staff and students, where, together, we strive to actively engage students in learning. Participation and achievement are measured, monitored and celebrated. By the end of their physical education at Park, students should have developed a personal commitment to, and genuine passion for, maintaining their health and well-being into adult life.</p> 
            <p>During Key Stage 3 and 4 core PE the department aim to inspire students to be active and engaged in a range of sports / activities contributing to an active healthy lifestyle. This is by offering routeways to personalised learning and promote physical activity. For example, competitive sports v health related fitness.</p>
            <p>Within Key Stage 4 examination PE we endeavour to develop depth of knowledge in areas of sport and fitness. Aiding success through the implementation of revision strategies for unit focus. Linking practical and theory to apply knowledge. Ensuring feedback is given (constantly) both verbally and written throughout tasks. Progress is tracked and visible to all throughout lessons. Summative feedback assigned with an expectation of independent application with a 15-day improvement window. A comprehensive revision guide is produced by the department and given to all students to support independent preparation for exams.</p>
            <p>In summary, our core curriculum offers students ownership of their physical education experience at Park. Allowing each student to select the most suitable routeway for themselves. This maybe through a highly competitive sports route, with specific focus on examination criteria and a high level of execution of key skills. Through a traditional PE experience or through an alternative health related fitness programme. This allows students to develop in-depth knowledge of body systems, components of fitness and methods of training through a range of fitness activities such as Zumba, yoga or circuit training. With a view that this empowers the students to continue practical involvement outside of education.</p>

        <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>All students will study sport at Park and within this they will develop a clear understanding of where to go next with assignments is shared within all lessons (pass criteria to merit and merit to distinction etc). Promoting accountability through strict deadlines and the sharing of each student's assignment completions, grade and actions to achieve projection (or higher). The department develop independence through structured stuck resources and models used within lessons and available to students through a shared platform.</p>
            <p>Through our structured curriculum and precise delivery of theory content examination outcomes have seen superb improvements over recent years with students becoming highly confident in unit content and assignment application.</p>
            <p>2023 = 98% Pass - distinction* (12 distinction*, 15 distinctions, 51 merits, 60 pass)</em></p>
            <p>2022 = 92.7% Pass - distinction* (19 distinction*/distinctions, 46 merits, 129 pass)</em></p>
            <p>2021 = 98.7% Pass - distinction* <em>(11 distinction*, 47 distinctions, 68 merits, 60 pass)</em></p>
            <p>2020 = 98.7% Pass - distinction* <em>(4 distinction*, 36 distinctions, 49 merits, 74 pass)</em></p> 
            <p>2019 = 100% Pass – distinction* <em>(66 distinction*, 23 distinctions, 36 merits, 19 pass)<em></p>
            <p>2018 = 100% Pass-distinction* <em>(63 distinction*, 17 distinctions, 54 merits, 20 pass)<em></p> 
            <p>2017 = 98% Pass – distinction*</p> 
            <p>Through our involvement of the students in their own learning, practical/physical improvement and development are evident within core PE. We experience increased participation and enjoyment seen through high levels of engagement in their personally chosen routeway within the subject. Students arrive to lessons with full PE kit and positive attitudes towards the lessons. This is seen through student voice surveys and observations lessons. Our curriculum allows connectedness between practical improvement and secured theory knowledge through deep thinking, high challenge and precise knowledge. Improvement in practical ability is not only seen within their chosen routeway activities but also measured through regular fitness testing throughout the year so students are able celebrate their individual development at regular intervals.</p>

                <p>PE lessons will take many forms which will engage and challenge students. PE teachers will use a combination of drill and game approaches to ensuring that students understand the requirements of certain sports and physical activities. Key skills such as leadership, teamwork and positive communication are encouraged throughout, and students will frequently be expected to problem solve as part of a group to overcome a scenario provided to them.</p>
                <p>Students who want to improve further will be encouraged to attend extra-curricular opportunities, and at times be asked to represent the school across a number of sports. Those students that are outstanding performers may be asked to take on leadership roles within lessons, with the opportunity to be part of the sports ambassador programme.</p>

                <p>Online exams are completed in BTEC Sport by students to ensure unit achievement this is through developed knowledge from KS3 theory input. Practical assessment is completed through BTEC criteria of Pass / Merit in relation to performance and application of skills within practise and competitive situations.</p>  
                <p>A tracker is used throughout every lesson for immediate feedback on progress to course / unit completion and to what grade. Students can reflect on current working grade compared to projection and are able to then implement feedback and next step criteria effectively. Further feedback takes place after students have completed units of work at the end of each term/deadline which they are then issued this feedback form and 15 days to implement improvements.</p>  
                <p>Regular feedback is given in books and on summative assessment forms at the end of units/assignments. It is also seen every lesson through verbal diagnostic conversations with suggested improvements. Books show specific feedback which stretch the level of understanding which is also specific to the attainment criteria for that task. Exemplar assignments are used throughout the course to promote independence and implementation of I do, you do, and we do. This is measured through progress on the class tracker and shown in improved work within portfolios.</p>
