            <p>Horticulture at Park Community School prepares students to engage with a rapidly developing Horticultural industry, where students can learn theory-based knowledge about plant families, soil types, plant foods and pollinators (relevant to the wider Horticultural industry), current industry practice in propagation, whilst developing practical and creative design skills, to a certified standard.</p>

            <h3>Intent</h3>
            <p>Our aim is to offer a rich, challenging, varied curriculum that ensures all students will have the opportunity to produce excellent work by pushing their own boundaries and exploring their creativity through real-life opportunities that foster skills develop, confidence, independence and resilience.</p>
            <p>Horticultural students will develop knowledge and skills to certification level, in a wholly different learning environment inside and out, where skill in plant and seed propagation, vegetative propagation and ornamental plant cultivation will be taught and developed further, so that students can develop their own creative ideas, which are crucial in a modern economy, but often in short supply.</p>
            <p>The work plan is aimed at practical and theory work to stimulate students’ intellectual curiosity and offer real-life opportunities for them to develop horticultural skills, work collaboratively, and become confident, independent learners.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>

            <p>The knowledge and skills that students develop through their learning in horticulture is designed to open pathways to a wide range of career opportunities, both in the locality and elsewhere. These pathways can lead to careers as varied as Horticultural consultant, turf manager, landscape designer, Landscape gardener, Vegetable farmer, Plant scientist, Market gardener, Specialist gardener, forestry worker, and florist. They can also lead to related fields such as scientific research, and food processing.</p>
