            <h3>Intent</h3>
                    <p>The vision of mathematics and teaching at park community school is to inspire and engage students in their understanding of number and wider areas of the subject. Problem solving is integral to the way in which we teach mathematics at the school. Our curriculum provides a foundation for understanding and developing students’ ability to reason, whilst also nurturing curiosity and enjoyment for the subject.
                    </p>
                    <p>We aim to develop students’ understanding of mathematical concepts and processes to enable students to solve problems using a variety of techniques and skills. This requires students to be fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics and to reason mathematically. This occurs through repeated practise to increase fluency and mastery, use of skills in familiar and unfamiliar contexts, learning of formulae, application to calculations, analysis and interpretation of mathematical information, as well as contextualising and applying appropriate elements to situations within which students are familiar.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    <ul class="circle">
                        <li>Number</li>
                        <li>Algebra</li>
                        <li>Ratio, Proportion and Rates of Change</li>
                        <li>Geometry and measures: learn and apply formulae solve problems</li>
                        <li>Probability</li>
                        <li>Statistics</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Years 7 - 11 – from years 7 to 11 we follow a single programme of study leading to a GCSE in mathematics.</p>
                    <p>Years 7 - 9 - our key stage 3 curriculum is designed to equip students with the mathematical knowledge and skill to successfully embark on their GCSE course in Year 10. It covers the full mathematical spectrum of Number, Ratio, Algebra, Geometry, Statistics and Probability required for their GCSE. We help the students achieve mastery in the use of this knowledge by emphasising the importance of using mathematical reasoning when solving problems in many different contexts.
                    </p>
                    <p>Years 10 - 11 - our key stage 4 curriculum continues to build towards GCSE mathematics. The syllabus we follow is AQA for students studying foundation level and Edexcel for students studying higher level.</p>
                    <p>We also offer GCSE statistics as an additional GCSE qualification to those pupils who wish to pursue it.</p>

                        <p>The foundation course covers a range of topics in Number, Algebra, Shape and Data handling. It emphasises students’ ability to reason with and use these skills in unfamiliar contexts in order for them to be able to apply them to real life problems.</p>

                        <p>The higher course takes these topics further so students can tackle more complex and mathematically abstract problems, as well as giving them the basis they need to use Mathematics beyond GCSE.</p>

            </ul>

            <p>The final qualification consists of three written examination papers:</p>
            <ul class="circle">
              <li>Paper 1 is a non-calculator assessment. A calculator is allowed for Paper 2 and Paper 3.</li>
              <li>Each paper is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The new GCSE syllabus is far more demanding than in previous years.
