            <h3>Intention</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Engage students in the process of psychological enquiry.</li>
				<li>Help students develop as effective and independent learners, and as critical and reflective thinkers with enquiring minds.</li>
				<li>For students to develop an awareness of why psychology matters.</li>
				<li>Enable students to acquire knowledge and understanding of how psychology works and its essential role in society.</li>
				<li>Support students in developing an understanding of the relationship between psychology and social, cultural, scientific and contemporary issues, and its impact on everyday life.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><em>What makes people tick? Why do some people behave the way they do?</em></p>
			<p>Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and human behaviour. Psychologists observe and conduct experiments to find out more about the way people act and interact. They try to understand what motivates, challenges or changes us and use this understanding to help us tackle personal and social problems.</p>
			<p>At Park Community School we intend to give students a broad introduction to a range of areas within Psychology, to help them develop critical and analytical thinking alongside developing research skills.  The course will provide students with a sound understanding of the various methods and approaches in psychology at an introductory level. This will provide a basis for those students who are considering studying Psychology at a higher level.</p>

				    <td>Perception<br></td>
				    <td>Through this unit you will explore how it is that we perceive the<br>world the way that we do.  We will look at how the brain allows us to<br>see a stable consistent world, the role of nature and nurture in<br>perception, optical illusions and how other factors such as our<br>emotional state can affect our perception of the world.</td>

				    <td>Development</td>
				    <td>This unit looks at how humans develop and learn.  We will explore<br>early brain development, followed by investigating theories of<br>cognitive development and how learning can affect this development. <br>This unit is about how our mental abilities develop and the role<br>education plays in this.</td>

				  <tr>
				    <td>10</td>
				    <td>Research Methods</td>

				    <td>Social Influence</td>

				    <td></td>
				    <td>Language Thought and Communication</td>
				    <td>This unit looks at the ways in which human beings communicate.  We<br>will explore the relationship between language and thought, how human<br>communication is different from animal communication and the types<br>and influence of non-verbal communication.</td>

				    <td></td>
				    <td>Brain and Neuropsychology</td>

				    <td>Psychological Problems<br></td>
				    <td>This unit offers an introduction to mental health, including its<br>characteristics and the challenges posed by mental health issues to<br>society today.  This is followed by an exploration of two specific<br>examples of common mental health issues in the U.K; depression and<br>addiction.</td>

			<h3>Impact</h3>
			<p>Students will leave us with a deeper understanding and appreciation of the way our minds work and the influence we have on each other as groups and individuals.  They will be more self-aware, and they will leave us having developed critical and analytical thinking, alongside an appreciation of how scientific research is carried out.  Students will leave with a GCSE demonstrating their achievement and progress in this, and more prepared to interact positively with society in modern Britain.  They will leave fully prepared to continue studying Psychology at a higher level.</p>
