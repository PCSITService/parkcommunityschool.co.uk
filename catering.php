                    <h3>Our Chef <small>- Steven Cross</small></h3>
                    <p>Cooking has always been our Head Chef’s passion and from a very young age Steven Cross cooked at home with his mother, who is also a chef.  After leaving school he went straight to South Downs College where he studied catering for four years.</p>
                    <p>Steven relished his time studying at college. He was rewarded with work placements in Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, where he worked alongside some very talented chefs.</p>
                    <p>On leaving college Steven focused on gaining experience at the highest level and worked within AA rosetted establishments and Michelin star restaurants. Although extremely hard work, Steven loved the challenge.  Steven worked in such places as 36 On The Quay in Emsworth and JSW in Petersfield.</p>
                    <p>On joining Park Community School, Steven’s focus was to redefine school meals and ensure all our students got a healthy well balanced meal throughout the school day. Steven worked tirelessly to set up Park Catering Services and he is proud to say that good food for all has successfully been embedded within the school’s ethos.</p>
                    <p>Steven runs the school farm growing a large percentage of our own fruit and vegetables which are used within the school kitchens.  We have also reared more than 80 pigs on the farm, the meat from which has been used for school lunches.  Steven has been instrumental in forging links with local food producers to increase our organic produce usage.</p>
                    <p>Looking to the future, Steven is now developing Park Catering Services to help our students and community to understand how to grow their own food, food processes and benefits of a healthy nutritious diet.</p>

                        <p>Park Community School are delighted to announce that they have been awarded the prestigious Food for Life Gold award which recognises that a healthy climate‐friendly food culture has been established within the school. Park is the only school in Hampshire with a valid Gold Award and within the UK one of only 3 secondary schools.</p>
                        <p>Since joining Food for Life, Park Community School has shown that it is possible to transform school food culture when a whole school approach is taken. This has been driven by our Head Chef Steven Cross, our catering team and Student Food Ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>Students of Park Community School assist in the rearing of pigs, chickens, ducks and quails and in the growing of vegetables and fruit for the school kitchen. Meetings take place regularly to discuss forthcoming menus and to sample the food, ensuring they meet all requirements. Thus, the school has seen a rise in the uptake of school meals proving that great school food combined with food education is best way to encourage children to eat more healthily.</p>
                        <p><strong>James Cashmore, Director of Food for Life stated: </strong><br>
                        "I'm delighted to announce that Park Community School has achieved the Food for Life Gold Award for creating a healthy, sustainable and enjoyable food culture within the school and its community to the benefit of everybody involved.</p>
                        <p>The school shows what real 21st century education is all about, which is using real life experiences to teach the curriculum and providing the next generation with solutions to what threatens their future, namely climate change and the obesity crisis. By empowering the young people to make informed food choices and giving them the skills to grow and cook food for themselves and their families, Park Community School leads the way for a more sustainable future."</p>
                        <p><strong>Head Chef, Steven Cross said: </strong><br>
                        “The Restaurant has become the hub of the school and is well used by students, staff and our wider community every day. ‘What is for lunch’ is a regular topic of conversation as is ‘what else can we include in the daily menus’. Students enjoy visiting our farm and helping with our market garden and seeing the produce used in our school meals.”</p>
                        <p>Christopher Anders, Headteacher appreciates the value of outside validation in all that we do. We believe we are “Much More Than Just a School” and this award further shows how much more.</p>
                        <p>Within school the quality of our food reflects the passion we have to ensure our students have the best meals we can provide. We continually explore ways to expand our provision for students and their families. The market garden is a popular place for our students linking food to its source.</p>

                    <p>As a school we were aware of the food poverty that some of our community experience and were concerned our students were going hungry. This was reinforced when our local community told us how the food bank was consistently running out of food. We set up a community group to tackle food poverty in our area and in April 2017 MUNCH was born.</p>
