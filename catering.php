                    <h3>Our Chef <small>- Alex Moody</small></h3>
                    <p>Cooking has always been our Head Chef’s passion and from a very young age Alex Moody cooked at home with his parents. After leaving school he studied catering at South Downs College for two years and went on to an apprenticeship at a local hotel. Alex has spent the last seven years at Park working with Steve Cross, LACA School Chef of the Year. Alex won the South East LACA competition in 2021</p>
                    <p>At Park Community School, Alex and the school’s multi-award winning catering team, continue to redefine school food to ensure all our students receive a healthy well-balanced meal during the school day. Alex is developing and nurturing the talents within the catering team, whose members are rightly proud of the good food that has successfully been embedded into the life of the school and its community.</p>
                    <p>Alex and the team introduce the students to cuisines from around the world by, for instance, encouraging them to taste Korean kimchi, Middle Eastern tagines, and Japanese inspired sushi. Three days a week students work in the kitchen alongside our chefs and catering team as part of our Much More Than Just A School curriculum</p>
                    <p>The catering team work closely with the market garden team helping them to grow our own fruit and vegetables which are used within the school kitchens. We have reared over 200 pigs on our small holding; the meat is used in school lunches, meals within the community and at external events. Through the Market Garden they learn about Farm to Fork ethos and all that it entails.</p>
                    <p>The catering team played an important role in establishing the Munch Food programme in 2017. Munch provides everyone who comes with a hot two course meal every school holiday and on Thursday evenings. The school also opens on Christmas Day and, in 2021, 140 people across the age-range enjoyed a three course Christmas Lunch, with entertainment and a splendid visit by Father Christmas despite the challenges of Covid.</p>
                    <p>To further meet the needs of our community the catering team produce nutritious ready meals which are available for collection seven days a week from the Munch emergency freezer in our Dickinson Centre.</p>
                    <p>To encourage healthy eating beyond school, the team provides cookery lessons for families, where family members come together, cook a meal, eat some of it with us and have plenty remaining to take home.</p>
                    <p>In 2019, Park Community School was one of nine successful organisations selected by the Department for Education (DfE) to run holiday activities.  As part of this, we produced a range of menus for daily meals; this was subsequently used by the DfE as good practice and formed the basis of the recently announced Holiday Activity Programme (HAF) which now runs across every local authority in England.</p>

                        <p>Park Community School are delighted to announce that they have been awarded the prestigious Food for Life Gold award which recognises that a healthy climate‐friendly food culture has been established within the school. Park is the only school in Hampshire with a valid Gold Award and within the UK one of only 3 secondary schools.</p>
                        <p>Since joining Food for Life, Park Community School has shown that it is possible to transform school food culture when a whole school approach is taken. This has been driven by our Head Chef Steven Cross, our catering team and Student Food Ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>Students of Park Community School assist in the rearing of pigs, chickens, ducks and quails and in the growing of vegetables and fruit for the school kitchen. Meetings take place regularly to discuss forthcoming menus and to sample the food, ensuring they meet all requirements. Thus, the school has seen a rise in the uptake of school meals proving that great school food combined with food education is best way to encourage children to eat more healthily.</p>
                        <p><strong>James Cashmore, Director of Food for Life stated: </strong><br>
                        "I'm delighted to announce that Park Community School has achieved the Food for Life Gold Award for creating a healthy, sustainable and enjoyable food culture within the school and its community to the benefit of everybody involved.</p>
                        <p>The school shows what real 21st century education is all about, which is using real life experiences to teach the curriculum and providing the next generation with solutions to what threatens their future, namely climate change and the obesity crisis. By empowering the young people to make informed food choices and giving them the skills to grow and cook food for themselves and their families, Park Community School leads the way for a more sustainable future."</p>
                        <p><strong>Head Chef, Steven Cross said: </strong><br>
                        “The Restaurant has become the hub of the school and is well used by students, staff and our wider community every day. ‘What is for lunch’ is a regular topic of conversation as is ‘what else can we include in the daily menus’. Students enjoy visiting our farm and helping with our market garden and seeing the produce used in our school meals.”</p>
                        <p>Christopher Anders, Headteacher appreciates the value of outside validation in all that we do. We believe we are “Much More Than Just a School” and this award further shows how much more.</p>
                        <p>Within school the quality of our food reflects the passion we have to ensure our students have the best meals we can provide. We continually explore ways to expand our provision for students and their families. The market garden is a popular place for our students linking food to its source.</p>

                    <p>As a school we were aware of the food poverty that some of our community experience and were concerned our students were going hungry. This was reinforced when our local community told us how the food bank was consistently running out of food. We set up a community group to tackle food poverty in our area and in April 2017 MUNCH was born.</p>
