          <h2>Prepare for your Next Step</h2>
          <p>At Park we believe that a good careers education is a vital part in raising our student’s aspirations and assist them in making informed decisions about their future. We pride ourselves in ensuring that our students are ready and prepare for their next steps in many ways.</p>

            <h2 id="modalTitle">How do we prepare you for your next step?</h2>
            <p>At Park we have countless opportunities for our students to work with employers, further and higher education providers. All of our year 10 students undertake hands on work experience for two weeks in the summer term, building on smaller work experiences we offer to the younger year groups.</p>
            <p>Every student is given a 1:1 appointment with our Hampshire Futures Careers Adviser, where time is spent thinking about their next step and choosing a course, college or apprenticeship to suit them. They also have a chance to explore the labour market with a fully qualified Level 6 adviser ensuring they are making informed decisions about where their educational choices could lead them.</p>
            <p>Our Careers programme ensures all students are provided with opportunities to think about their strengths and weaknesses and how this could link to their futures in the world of work. All our subject departments are experts at linking their subjects to possible career paths and encourage our students to look to where their subject specialism could lead them.</p>
            <p>The careers programme is lead by Mrs Munoz the school’s Career Leader, it is reviewed and adapted annually. <a href="/assets/policies/ceiag.pdf">The full Careers Education, Information, Advice and Guidance (CEIAG) Policy</a> can be viewed online. The next few pages will show you exactly what the students experience in each year group within our careers programme.</p>

            <h2 id="modalTitle">Gatsby Benchmarks</h2>
            <p>The Gatsby Benchmarks are now used to define the essentials of good career guidance in schools. The seven Gatsby Benchmarks are explained below. Schools are asked to use a compass tool to assess their progress to achieving the seven Gatsby Benchmarks and I am pleased to say Park Community School achieves very highly in each of the sections.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>A STABLE CAREERS PROGRAMME</strong></li>
              <p>Every school and college should have an embedded programme of career education and guidance that is known and understood by students, parents, teachers and employers.</p>
              
              <li><strong>LEARNING FROM CAREER AND LABOUR MARKET INFORMATION</strong></li>
              <p>Every student should have access to good quality information about future study options and labour market opportunities. They will need the support of an informed adviser to make the best use of available information.</p>
              <li><strong>ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF EACH STUDENT</strong></li>
              <p>Students have different career guidance needs at different stages. Opportunities for advice and support need to be tailored to the needs of each student. A school’s careers programme should embed equality and diversity considerations throughout.</p>
              <li><strong>LINKING CURRICULUM LEARNING TO CAREERS</strong></li>
              <p>All teachers should link curriculum learning with careers. For example, STEM subject teachers should highlight the relevance of STEM subjects for a wide range of career pathways.</p>
              <li><strong>ENCOUNTERS WITH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES</strong></li>
              <p>Every student should have multiple opportunities to learn from employers about work, employment and the skills that are valued in the workplace. This can be through a range of enrichment opportunities including visiting speakers, mentoring and enterprise schemes.</p>
              <li><strong>EXPERIENCE OF WORKPLACES</strong></li>
              <p>Every student should have first-hand experiences of the workplace through work visits, work shadowing and/or work experience to help their exploration of career opportunities and expand their networks.</p>
              <li><strong>ENCOUNTERS WITH FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION</strong></li>
              <p>All students should understand the full range of learning opportunities that are available to them. This includes both academic and vocational routes and learning in schools, colleges, universities and in the workplace.</p>
              <li><strong>PERSONAL GUIDANCE</strong></li>
              <p>Every student should have opportunities for guidance interviews with a Careers Adviser. These should be available whenever significant study or career choices are being made.</p>

          <p>By the age of 16, every student should have had a meaningful encounter (a ‘meaningful encounter’ is one in which the student has an opportunity to explore what it is like to learn in that environment) with providers of the full range of learning opportunities, including sixth forms, colleges, universities and apprenticeship providers. This should include the opportunity to meet both staff and students. By the age of 18, all students who are considering applying for university should have had at least two visits to universities to meet staff and students.</p>
          <p>At Park Community School we have an excellent Gifted and Talented programme where gifted and talented students are taken to a selection of universities to experience what it is like and the opportunities open to them.</p>
          <p>Our gifted and talented students visit Portsmouth, Southampton, Oxford including a residential open to Y10 students and 1:1 mentoring program.</p>
          <p>However all students also get the opportunity to work with Chichester and Portsmouth University several times throughout their time at Park.</p>

            <h2 id="modalTitle">Apprenticeships &amp; Degree Level Apprenticeships</h2>
            <h4>What are they?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Apprenticeships are a mixture of working (and earning) and learning. Just like college, there are apprenticeships for all levels of ability and qualifications.</li>
              <li>They range from “Intermediate” apprenticeships that may require anything from no qualifications to 5 GCSEs, to “Degree” apprenticeships.</li>
              <li>Apprenticeships are skills-based, flexible learning programmes and can take anything between 1 to 4 years to complete, depending on the level of difficulty involved and the ability of the apprentice.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Why choose an Apprenticeship?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Earn while you learn. Rates of pay vary, but the national minimum hourly wage is currently £3.50 per hour.</li>
              <li>You know what you want to do for a career and are keen to start getting qualified and gain the skills you need.</li>
              <li>You like the idea of working alongside experience staff who will train you.</li>
              <li>You are confident and committed enough to face strong competition for an apprenticeship place and can pass the initial assessments.</li>
              <li>You are happy and able to work a minimum of 30 hours a week and study alongside this to gain your qualifications.</li>
              <li>You can now study at degree level and an apprenticeship is a good way to gain a degree level qualification without paying university fees.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Where can an Apprenticeship lead?</h4>
            <p>From an Apprenticeship you can go on to;</p>
