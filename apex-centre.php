            <p>At the Apex Centre we are now providing practical, hands-on courses for students from Park Community School and a variety of other schools in the area and beyond. Our aim is to give students the opportunity to learn a whole range of construction skills, whilst ensuring that curriculum requirements are met.</p>
            <p>This has been possible because Park Community Enterprises Ltd have leased facilities named The Apex Centre, to accommodate this. This Centre is situated to the north east of the central shopping district of Leigh Park and is within fifteen minutes walking distance from Park Community School. It is within the school’s catchment area. The Apex Centre is just two minutes walk from the industrial unit we already lease.</p>
            <p>The recent government changes to school examinations and accreditations dictate that from 2016 non-academic courses have no ‘league table value’ to schools. A consequence of this is that schools now need to ensure any time spent on vocational learning is highly relevant to the student’s needs.</p>

            <p>The student can undertake a construction skills course leading to a LASER Level 1 in Construction Skills. The qualification is a Certification for Learning, Employability and Progression (LEAP). The qualification can be completed in one academic year with 5 hours of weekly tuition or over two academic years with one weekly 2 hour 30 minute session. A diluted LASER Level 1 Award is available to complete in one academic year with one weekly session.</p>
            <p>The units of study will include:</p>
            <ol>
            	<li>Brickwork/Blockwork</li>
				<li>Wallpapering</li>
				<li>Carpentry</li>
				<li>Plastering</li>
				<li>Construction</li>
				<li>Health and Safety</li>
				<li>Measurements of distance and length</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A LASER Level 2 LEAP Award or Certificate is an advanced option available for students who have completed the Level 1 equivalent. This can be completed in one academic year with two weekly sessions and is only available in Year 11.</p>
            <p>We believe we are best placed to address these needs of our students and other providers who are not yet aware of the implications of the forthcoming changes.</p>
